This entire text was run from fmlite/ai-summary/createSummary.py and turned into a text message you are now seeing.
What you see here is an overview of the 'fmlite' project’s source code and documented file purposes written in the author's own words.
The purposes are stored in a separate purpose.json file in the same folder as the script and is updated by me as i learn more about development in general, as i am still a beginner.
Files marked 'PURPOSE_NOT_DEFINED' have no documented purpose yet.

After reading this text in full, write back the total number of PURPOSE_NOT_DEFINED files, and explain in 125 words or less a summary of what this project is about and what it does.
